    My career bridges information security, physical security, policy development, training, ethics, and continuity management. I am dedicated to
    My professional path began in the Canadian Armed Forces, where I developed a unique blend of technical, operational, and leadership skills.

Each role challenged me to think critically, act decisively, and uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethics, even in high-pressure situations.
